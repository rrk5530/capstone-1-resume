    <h2>Being Cancerian</h2>
    <p>Ability to exist in both emotional and material realms. Highly intuitive and my psychic abilities manifest in tangible spaces: 
        For instance, I can effortlessly pick up the energies in a room. 
        I am highly sensitive to their environments, as well as extremely self-protective. 
        Crabs are shielded by hard, external shells. 
        At first, these I may be perceived as cold or distant. With time, 
        though, I reveal my gentle nature, genuine compassion, 
        and mystical capabilities. Just don't be surprised if it takes a while to get to know me.</p>

        <p>Cancer is ruled by the moon, the celestial body that represents comfort, self-care, and 
            maternal energies. Accordingly, we tend to be domestically oriented. 
            we love to create cozy, safe spaces that serve as their personal sanctuaries, 
            then spend lots of time in them. I care deeply about our families and am quick to adopt caregiver roles. 
            But these crabs must be careful: When Cancers invest in someone emotionally, 
            they risk blurring the line between attentive nurturing and controlling behavior.</p>
            <p>Cancers attract friends and lovers through their loyalty, commitment, and emotional depth. 
                These crustaceans make excellent hosts and enjoy entertaining with comfort food and free-flowing libations. 
                (Cancer rules the stomach, so there’s nothing these crabs love more than a home-cooked meal.) 
                If you're not a fan of Cancer’s attachment to the home, that may be a bit of a problem. 
                Though these celestial crabs avoid direct conflict by walking at an angle, they can inflict a harsh pinch with their distinctive brand of passive-aggressiveness. 
                It may be difficult to convince a Cancer to talk openly about what's bothering them, 
                but if you can do it without making them feel threatened, you'll build long-lasting trust.</p>
